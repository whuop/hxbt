# hxbt

Behavior Tree implementation for Haxe.

### Installation Instructions

#### Using haxelib ( Recommended )
hxbt hasn't yet been added as a haxelib package, but will be in the future. You can however manually add it once you have cloned the repository. To add hxbt to haxelib simple use the following command:

haxelib dev hxbt path/to/hxbt

#### Not using haxelib

Clone the repository or download as zip. Drag and drop src/hxbt folder to the src folder of your project.

### Usage

The samples folder contains projects demonstrating how hxbt works and is a perfect place to get an idea of how the library can be used. 

All samples are located in the samples folder https://github.com/whuop/hxbt/tree/master/samples/.

### Are you using hxbt for a project?

If you are, please let me know. I would love to see what people are creating using the library. And who knows, maybe I'll make a small showcase of games using hxbt in the future.
